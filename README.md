This repo is for .NET development course CIT 365

I'll be graduating with a degree in CIT in April, so this is last my last semester. I grew up in Washington but six years ago my family moved to Utah. I've been a student at BYU-Idaho for almost two years and I went to Utah State for two years before that.
